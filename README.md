## 📝 Description

Flm Compagnon is a modern GUI designed to accompany and manage the **FastFlowLM (FLM)** project. It offers a smooth user experience to interact with your local AI models, monitor the server, and manage your configurations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This application requires **[FastFlowLM (FLM)](https://github.com/FastFlowLM/FastFlowLM)** to be installed on your system. Without it, Flm Compagnon will not function.

## ✨ Features

* **Models**: Model manager (download, delete, inspect details).
* **Server**: Configuration and management of the FLM server instance.
* **Resource Monitor**: Real-time NPU and RAM usage monitoring with historical charts when server is running.
* **Presets**: Save and manage custom server configurations as presets for quick access.
* **System Tray**: Quick access to server controls, **model selection**, **presets**, and status directly from the notification area.
* **Auto-Updates**: Automatic update check at startup for both FLM Companion and FastFlowLM with integrated installer.
* **Auto-start**: Option to launch the application automatically at system startup.
* **Start Minimized**: Option to launch the application minimized to the system tray (configurable in settings).
* **Settings**: Application customization.
* **About**: View application version, hardware information, FLM changelog, and check for updates.
* **Multilingual**: Interface management in **English, French, and Japanese**.
* **Theme**: Management of light and dark themes.
